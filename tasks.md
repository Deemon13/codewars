// 8kyu. task-001. Grasshopper - Summation //

Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example (Input -> Output): 2 -> 3 (1 + 2); 8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)

// 8kyu. task-002. String repeat //

Write a function that accepts an integer n and a string s as parameters, and returns a string of s repeated exactly n times.

For example (Input -> Output): 6, "I"     -> "IIIIII"; 5, "Hello" -> "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

// 8kyu. task-003. Beginner - Reduce but Grow //

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the result of multiplying the values together in order.

Example: [1, 2, 3, 4] => 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24

// 8kyu. task-004. Will you make it? //

You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left.

Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not.

Function should return true if it is possible and false if not.

// 8kyu. task-005. Function 1 - hello world //

Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

Style Points
Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative "hello world" you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

// 7kyu. task-006. Square Every Digit //

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

// 7kyu. task-007. Shortest Word //

Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).

String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.

// 7kyu. task-008. Reverse words //

Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

Examples:
"This is an example!" ==> "sihT si na !elpmaxe"
"double  spaces"      ==> "elbuod  secaps"

// 8kyu. task-009. Returning Strings //

Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]
